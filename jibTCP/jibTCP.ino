// This code reads commands from serial port (USB wire) or W5500 ethernet shield and controls 3 stepper motors via TMC2130 drivers.
// This code runs on atmega 328p microcontroller (Arduino Uno or Nano)
/* todo:
 * jerk limit?
 * adjust sg_stall_value based on input voltage
 * POWER & TORQUE:
	 * adjust setCurrent, power_down_delay, microsteps etc.
	 * enable coolStep for power savings and less heating
	 * high torque mode for heavy lifting (and homing?), low torque for power savings
	 * use stallGuard value to limit speed to prevent motors stalling
 * ISR is not sending step pulses perfectly evenly when spinning many motors at the same time

// TMC2130 pin connections
	/* You need to connect the SPI pins as follows for programming the TMC2130. If you have several TMC2130, they all must use these same pins.
		SDI --> D11
		SDO --> D12
		SCK --> D13
	En --> GND // enable (CFG6). I want driver always enabled, so connect EN --> GND
	Dir --> GND // direction can also be controlled through SPI, so to save pins, connect DIR --> GND
	Step (slew) --> D4 
	Step (trolley) --> D5
	Step (hook) --> D6
	And on top of that you need to also connect motor coils
		M1A and M1B to one coil and
		M2A and M2B to another coil
	Finally connect the power wires
		GND --> GND
		VIO --> 5V
		VM --> motor power supply (5 - 45 V) and > 100 ÂµF capacitor */
